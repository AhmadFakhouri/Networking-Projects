Network Overview
The network consists of three Cisco routers (Riyadh, Jeddah, AlDammam) interconnected via serial links and connected to LAN segments. The primary objectives are:

Enable OSPF routing across all sites.
Block unauthorized FTP access from PC Z (172.16.3.7) to the FTP/Web server (172.16.1.20).
Restrict traffic from a specific host (172.16.1.2) to 172.16.2.5.
